# Deprecated

Why? The project was meant to allow users generate [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags and embed them in an empty message in Discord as for the newer update that tested markdown features like headings, lists & [hyperlinks](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/12m9ytf). You could make an empty link like this:

```
[** **](https://example.com/)
```

But after the initial global release of the markdown update Discord decided to remove the feature [temporarily](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/13ptycq/comment/jlb8kn5) for [obvious reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULTWJB1Edlc) thus project is archived for *some time*.
